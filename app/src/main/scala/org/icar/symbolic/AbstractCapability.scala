 * some parameters and the description of its usage
 * Example:
 * Capability OpenSwitch[switchID : Switcher] {
 * ...
 * }
 *
 * @param id      univoque name of the Capability
 * @param params  list of parameters that characterizes different resulting actions
 * @param pre     description of preconditions in order the action may be seelcted
 * @param post    description of postconditions to be true in the state just after the action execution
 * @param effects description of how the state will be affected by the actions
 * @param future  goals that MUST hold after the action execution
